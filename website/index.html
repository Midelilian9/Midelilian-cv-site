    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        A dedicated Human Resource professional with a Master's in HR Management and Training, and a strong 
        background in recruitment, employee engagement, and policy development. I have a proven track record in 
        leading teams, managing HR processes, and utilising HR analytics to enhance organisational efficiency. 
        The gap in my CV is due to relocation and studying. Having completed my Master's degree, I am now seeking 
        a Human Resource role to leverage my skills and contribute to a dynamic organisation.
